## Overview
This project is a clone of the popular online word game "Bomb Party". The game challenges players to quickly think of words that match a given syllable before a timer runs out. This repository contains the code for replicating the gameplay experience of Bomb Party, including a wide range of syllables to help your vocabulary, with a turn timer to up the ante.

## Features
- **Word Knowledge**: Expand and renew your vocabulary with thousands of words!
- **Turn Timer**: A countdown timer starts when a new syllable is displayed, ends game when it reaches zero.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for correctly guessed words, and you can compare scores locally.
- **Lives**: Stay in the game with lives that can be refilled by collecting all of the letters! Acquire letters buy using them in your guesses. But be careful, the game ends when you lose all of your lives!
- **Interactive User Interface**: The game provides feedback to players on their actions, including helpful tips to improve performance and improve vocabulary.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bomb-party-clone.git`
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Run `turkish word fixer.py` to format the word list to your liking.
4. Run `syllable finder.py`, making sure to clearly state file locations, to generate the JSON for the game.
5. Open `index.html` in a web browser to play the game.

## Play
- Upon starting the game, a syllable will be displayed, and the turn timer will begin counting down.
- Enter a word that matches the displayed syllable into the text field and press enter (or the submit button).
- If the word is correct, you will earn a point, and a new syllable will be displayed.
- If the word is incorrect or has already been guessed, you will receive a warning message, and you can try again!
- The game continues until the timer runs out, at which point the final scores are displayed.
